            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>When the sleepers first enter the New York dream, Arthur, Eames, and Saito kidnap Fischer. Fischer hands
              Eames his wallet, telling him to take it and leave. The moment Eames takes the wallet Fischer's projections
              begin to attack Cobb's team.
  
            Meanwhile, Cobb's subconscious inserts a freight train into the middle of the street (the same freight
              train
              that Cobb and Mal committed suicide under while in Limbo), splitting up the team, and allowing Saito to be
              shot. Eventually, the team regroups in a warehouse and establishes that Fischer has trained his subconscious
              to defend itself from extraction and invasion. Certain security projections are militarized. Cobb's team
              becomes concerned and learns that death within this dream cannot wake a sleeper due to the strength of the
              sedative, only send the sleeper's mind to Limbo. The team decides to continue the mission anyway.
  
            Eames forges the identity of Browning and tells Fischer of an alternate will that Fischer Sr. created to
              split up his company.
  
            The sleepers load into a van and all enter the Level 2 dream, with the exception of Yusuf, who drives the
              van, trying to avoid the projections.</p>

          <p>Entering the new level, they are able to convince Fischer that his stepfather is behind the kidnapping and

            joins their side.</p>

        <div>
          <h3>Objective:</h3>

            <div>
              <h3>Process</h3>
             <p>On the second level of the Fischer job, Cobb enacts a risky strategy to persuade Fischer accept the team
                members as his allies and suggest that Peter Browning cannot be trusted before descending deeper into
                Fischer's subconscious. To distract Fischer, Eames disguises himself as a blonde woman to distract Fischer
                and draw the attention of his subconscious security away by stealing his wallet, before Cobb approaches
                Fischer as "Mr. Charles", a supposed projection of Fischer's who exists to protect him from extraction.
             
  
              As Cobb attempts to persuade Fischer into accepting him as a projection by revealing that Fischer is
                dreaming, Arthur (the dreamer) and Ariadne notice the immediate effects of Fischer's subconscious reacting
                to knowledge that he is dreaming. They move to set the charges in room 491 to prepare for the kick, such
                that the dreamers in the room above (room 528) will fall when Arthur detonates the charges when Yusuf
                drives
                the van off a bridge in the first level.
  
              Cobb succeeds in convincing Fischer that he is an ally and the rest of the team meet them in room 528,
                where
                a projection of Peter Browning appears, conjured by Fischer as part of his growing distrust towards him
                and
                increasing belief that his father, Maurice had wanted something different for him. Fischer and the team
                enter another dream level, while Arthur remains behind to defend them from Fischer's projections.</p>
